# Traveling-Salesman-Problem
# The Traveling Salesman Problem consists of finding the shortest and longest paths along a set number of points (cities)
# This code finds the shortest path, but by changing the distance comparison, the longest can be found too
# The text file used consists of 1000 2D points seperated by a comma and space
# A random search, random mutation hill climber (swapping 2 consecutive cities), and genetic algorithm (using a 2-point crossover among 2 individual solutions) were performed to find the shortest path using the data
